Landmark is a game built with the full MEAN stack, using Google Street View Image API and the Autocomplete functionality of the Google Places API. The player is confronted to a random street view somewhere in the world and has to find in which country he is situated to get one point and continue the game. He has one minute and a half to guess as many location as he can and try to beat the best score of the other users.
